# Decipher the Number
## Overview
Hello! I'm Mert, and on Day 12 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge, I'm thrilled to introduce "Decipher the Number". This Python game is a fun and interactive way to test your guessing skills, where you try to decipher a randomly selected number within a certain number of attempts.

## How It Works
"Decipher the Number" is straightforward and engaging:

* The game starts by displaying a welcome message and the rules.
* You choose a difficulty level: 'easy' (10 attempts) or 'hard' (5 attempts).
* The script generates a random number between 1 and 100 that you have to guess.
* You make a guess, and the game tells you if your guess is too high or too low.
* Your remaining attempts decrease with each incorrect guess.
* The game continues until you guess the number correctly or run out of attempts.
## Features
* Two Difficulty Levels: Choose between 'easy' and 'hard' modes to suit your preference.
* Random Number Generation: Each game is unique, with a randomly selected number to guess.
* Interactive Feedback: Receive immediate feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
* Attempt Tracking: Keep track of your remaining attempts to strategize your next guess.
* Input Validation: The game ensures that your inputs are valid numbers and prompts accordingly.
* Simple and Engaging Interface: Easy-to-follow prompts and a clear display of information make the game accessible and fun.
